			<h1>Welcome to my page</h1>
		</header>
		<p>
			This is just a simple webpage detailing some interesting things about me for whoever is willing to read it.
			Why is this page so plain and barren? Because, <i>personally</i>, I don't think a page like this requires anything more than simple HTML and CSS.
			Leave JS and its 1000 frameworks to sites that "need" it.

		<h2>
			Who I am
		</h2>
		<p>I'm a 20-something Scottish (my accent would leave you to believe otherwise) student studying in Norway with an interest in software, artificial intelligence and an admiration for animation and japanese culture. I'm also a big fan of video games.</p>
		<h2>
			What I do
		</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>I'm a student at the <a href="https://www.ntnu.no/">Norwegian University of Science and Technology</a> studying Informatics and specialising in Artificial Intelligence.</li>
			<li>I work part-time for the company Airthings as a front-end web developer (yes this is ironic given the appearance of this page)</li>
			<li>Right now I'm writing my master's thesis, which will is about genre transfer in raw audio. It's going well!...ish.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>
			What I like
		</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Machine learning and its various uses was the biggest inspiration for me to start studying again.</li>
			<li>I LOVE Linux and have been using it as my sole OS for years now. The sheer cutomisability and community support made me fall in love with the entire GNU/Linux environment.</li>
			<li>I've been playing video games for about as long as I could walk. Some of my all time favourites are:</li> 
				<ul>
				<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killer7">Killer7</a></li>
				<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Smash_Bros._Melee">Super Smash Bros. Melee</a></li>
				<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elder_Scrolls_III:_Morrowind">Morrowind</a></li>
				<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout:_New_Vegas">Fallout New Vegas</a></li>
				<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deus_Ex_(video_game)">Deus Ex</a></li>
				<li>The older titles of the Pokemon series (Everything before 2013)</li>
				<aside>
					But that's just scratching the surface of what I really really enjoy playing
				</aside>	
			</li>
			<li>I could go on forever about animation and anime so I'll just put that I love it and my favourite one is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKMzuuy_KQQ">FLCL (Fooly Cooly)</a> </li>
			</ul>
		</ul>
		<h2>
			What I'm up to these days
		</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>I've been playing around with various <a href="https://suckless.org/">suckless tools</a> such as <a href="https://dwm.suckless.org/">dwm</a> and <a href="https://st.suckless.org/">st</a>.
				I'm not a huge fan of the philosophy described on their site but the software is good and it has been a joy using it so I'm probably going to stick with it for now.</li>
			<li>I'm attempting to plan where to go after I graduate and before I start working full-time. Right now I have my eyes set on Japan but it seems sort of expensive. We will see...</li>
			<li>I recently bought myself a Thinkpad T420 so I can look into upgrading it and installing <a href="https://www.coreboot.org/">coreboot</a> onto it. It seems daunting but fun!</li>
			<li>I've been trying to learn Tekken 7 so I can get into fighting games that aren't Super Smash Bros at a competitive level. It's super tough but fun.</li>
		</ul>
